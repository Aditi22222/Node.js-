# Introduction to Node.js

- Node.js is an open-source, server-side platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime, allowing developers to build scalable network applications.
- It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient, suitable for real-time applications with high throughput.
- Node.js enables developers to write server-side code using JavaScript, a language traditionally used for client-side scripting in web browsers.
- It provides a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, known as npm (Node Package Manager), which simplifies the development process by offering reusable modules and tools.
- With Node.js, developers can create a wide range of applications, including web servers, APIs, command-line tools, desktop applications, and more.
- Its popularity continues to grow due to its performance, scalability, and versatility, making it a preferred choice for building modern web applications.

# History of Node.js

- **2009**: Ryan Dahl introduced Node.js, inspired by the need for a scalable server-side solution to handle I/O-bound operations.
- **2010**: Node.js gained attention for its performance and scalability, attracting developers interested in building real-time applications.
- **2011**: The first Node.js package manager, npm, was released, providing a vast ecosystem of modules and tools for developers.
- **2012**: Node.js gained significant adoption, with companies like LinkedIn, Netflix, and PayPal using it to power their applications.
- **2015**: The release of Node.js version 4.0 marked the convergence of the Node.js and io.js codebases, leading to improved collaboration within the Node.js community.
- **2018**: The release of Node.js version 10 introduced long-term support (LTS), ensuring stability and security for enterprise applications.
- **2020**: Node.js continued to evolve, with ongoing updates and enhancements to meet the changing demands of modern web development.

# Installation Process for Node.js

To install Node.js on your computer, follow these steps:

1. **Download Node.js**: Visit the official Node.js website at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and download the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

3. **Run Installer**: Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Accept the license agreement and choose the installation directory if prompted.

4. **Verify Installation**: After the installation is complete, open a command prompt or terminal window and type the following command to verify that Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) have been installed successfully:
node -v
npm -v
This command will display the installed version of Node.js and npm, respectively.

5. **Update npm (Optional)**: It's recommended to update npm to the latest version using the following command:
npm install npm@latest -g
This command will update npm to the latest stable version globally.

6. **Test Installation**: To ensure that Node.js is working correctly, create a simple JavaScript file (e.g., `app.js`) with the following code:
```javascript
console.log("Hello, Node.js!");
Save the file and run it using Node.js by typing the following command in the terminal
